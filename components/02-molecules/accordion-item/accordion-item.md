## Accordion item
### Fields
**Title**:
The title of the accordion item will be what the user clicks on in order to expand. It could be a question or a topic.

**Accompanying text**:
This area is what appears after the accordion title is clicked. While it can be as long as you want, containing as much content as you'd like, keep in mind that it will push down the other content on the page once expanded, so too much content in here could be jarring.

### Accessibility information
Users can tab through the different accordion items and open and close them using the "enter" key.
